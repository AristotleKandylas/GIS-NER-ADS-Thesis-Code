## About
This is the official repository of my master thesis in Applied Data Science at Utrecht University.

My research project presents two deep learning-based NER systems to extract geographic phenomena from geo-analytical questions and classify them into core concepts of spatial information that conceptually model and distinguish spatial information. The NER systems are trained by BERT and Bi-LSTM models on 278 geo-analytical questions and tested on 31 validation questions, from a corpus that contains 309 questions in total. The evaluation and comparison results showed that the BERT model had higher accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score on recognizing core concepts in geo-analytical questions, compared to Bi-LSTM.

The project's code is available for everyone interesting but also for those who want to develop NLP solution in the Geosciences scientific domain.

## This repository
This repository contains the documentation and  the code written about the master thesis.


Specifically:

**The preprocessing code** can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/AristotleKandylas/GIS-NER-ADS-Thesis-Code/blob/main/PRE_PROCESSING" target = "_blank"> PRE_PROCESSING folder</a> of this repository

**The tokenization code** can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/AristotleKandylas/GIS-NER-ADS-Thesis-Code/blob/main/TOKENIZATION" target = "_blank"> TOKENIZATION folder</a> of this repository

**The two developed Deep Learning Models'** can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/AristotleKandylas/GIS-NER-ADS-Thesis-Code/blob/main/DEEP_LEARNING_MODELS" target = "_blank"> DEEP_LEARNING_MODELS folder</a> of this repository

As the **dataset** used in this research, was provided by the <a href="https://github.com/quangis" target = "_blank"> QuAnGIS research group</a>, and no consent was obtained to share it publicly, I am unable to share the dataset in this repository.
